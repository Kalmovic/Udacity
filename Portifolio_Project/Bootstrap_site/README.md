# Project Portfolio

This project is my Professional Responsive Portfolio Web Page (in continous atualization).
This version of the project uses Bootstrap, included in the files, and `srcset`, for better optimization and save the user from wasting unnecessary bandwidth.

## How to run the program:


- Download the files needed. They are available [here](https://github.com/Kalmovic/Udacity/tree/master/movies), just in case you don't have them. _Be sure all the files are inside the same folder_.
- There you will find these folders:
    - **css**, where the css files can be found.
    - **images**, where the the images that the site uses are located.
    - **js**, where the JavaScript files are placed.
- There will be a `.html` file called index. Within the folder that you have downloaded, click on this file. It will open an web page with the site's content.
