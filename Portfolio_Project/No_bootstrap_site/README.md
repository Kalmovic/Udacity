# Project Portfolio

This version of the project does NOT use Bootstrap, I made it with flexbox and other css coding styles to make it fully responsive. It need some minor changes in the style.


## How to run the program:


- Download the files needed. They are available [here](https://github.com/Kalmovic/Udacity/tree/master/Portifolio_Project/No_bootstrap_site), just in case you don't have them. _Be sure all the files are inside the same folder_.
- There you will find these folders:
    - **css**, where the css files can be found.
    - **images**, where the the images that the site uses are located.
    - **js**, where the JavaScript files are placed.
- There will be a `.html` file called index. Within the folder that you have downloaded, click on this file. It will open an web page with the site's content.
