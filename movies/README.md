# Project Movie Trailers Website

This project has the objective of showing a list of movies and, when selected, to show it's trailer. When you have the cursor over the poster of the movie, it shows the storyline of that film.

## How to run the program:

- First, be sure you have Python downloaded, or a code editor that can run a Python file.
- Then, download the files needed. They are available [here](https://github.com/Kalmovic/Udacity/tree/master/movies), just in case you don't have them.
- There you will find three Pyhon files:
    - media.py, where the class Movie is defined
    - fresh_tomatoes.py, where the page is loaded and is the one you `run`
    - entertainment_center.py, where the list of movies is defined and it's information, such as Title, Storyline, Poster_Image and Movie_Trailer
- They need to be in the same folder
- Open the file fresh_tomatoes.py and run the program.
